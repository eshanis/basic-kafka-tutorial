= (Extremely) Basic Kafka Tutorial

I wanted to find a super simple tutorial to learn the basics of Kafka but couldn't find one so this repository is my attempt to create one.


== Launch Kafka

On one terminal window run the following command to launch a Kafka broker:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

The broker is accessible locally at `localhost:9092`, which we'll use when we connect to Kafka.

== Connect to Kafka

On another terminal window run the following command to launch Jupyter:

[source, bash]
----
pip install -r requirements && jupyter notebook
----

== Thanks

* The Docker Compose template is based on one shared with me by https://twitter.com/santand84[Andrea Santurbano^].
Andrea is the main author of https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-streams[Neo4j Streams^], the Neo4j Kafka Integration.

* The producer and consumer code in the notebooks is adapted from Adnan Siddiqi's https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-apache-kafka-in-python-604b3250aa05[Getting started with Apache Kafka in Python article^] and https://github.com/kadnan/Calories-Alert-Kafka[accompanying repository^].
